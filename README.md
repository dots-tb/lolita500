## TOTAL ACCELERATION to 500

[Discord Server](http://discord.cbps.xyz/)

Sets all clocks to max (including 500mhz for CPU) at all times and disables power limits like high brightness and Wi-Fi not working on intensive games.

### WARNING: THIS IS OBVIOUSLY EXPERIMENTAL AND CARRIES THE DANGERS OF OVERCLOCKING (FOR REAL OVERCLOCKING). Please proceed with caution.

### PS: Yifan Lu has labeled this mode as 494mhz, but seeing how the rest of the pervasive values correspond to a value slightly off, Celeste and dots have decided to label it 500mhz instead.

### PSA: Userland apps will report false speeds. 

# Installation

Put "lolita500.skprx" in 'tai' folder in 'ur0' or 'ux0' and add the following:

```text
*KERNEL
ur0:tai/lolita500.skprx
```

(Or just use AutoPlugin, he'll eventually add this anyway, I don't really care.)
